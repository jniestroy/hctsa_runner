# HCTSA Take 2

## Plan

1. Access to Rivanna (Might take a while for contractor)
2. Access to data on Rivanna
3. Write code
    1. Run algorithms code. Should make use of rivannas compute and also will need to put thought into output formatting (1 week)
    2. Track completion of patient processing code (.5 week)
    3. Estimate time to run & work with Randall on which ones we should run (couple hours)
4. Run code on all patients.
5. Perform clustering. (~1.5 week)
    1. Subsample in suitable way given size of data.
    2. Create matrix of algorithm "distances".
    3. Cluster in R. Evaluate results.

## Total working time: 2.5-3 weeks of work once I have access to Rivanna. Compuation time not included.
